Caesar Cipher Tool (Extended Latin Support)

A simple, educational Caesar Cipher application with GUI support and extended Latin alphabet handling — designed for clarity, correctness, and usability.

Features

Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption: Classic shift-based substitution cipher

Extended Latin Alphabet Support: Correct handling of Turkish characters (ç, ğ, ı, İ, ö, ş, ü)

Case Preservation: Uppercase and lowercase characters are preserved

GUI Interface: User-friendly desktop interface built with Tkinter

Input Safety: Output field is read-only to prevent accidental modification

Usage Scenarios

Learning basic cryptography concepts

Demonstrating classical encryption techniques

Educational projects and coursework

Simple text obfuscation for demonstrations

How It Works

Alphabetic characters are shifted by a user-defined value

English and Turkish alphabets are processed separately

Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged

Decryption is performed by reversing the shift value

Requirements

Python 3.x

Tkinter (included with standard Python installations)

Usage

Enter text into the Input Text field

Specify the Shift Value

Click Encrypt or Decrypt

View the result in the read-only Output Text field

Limitations

This implementation is intended for educational purposes only

Caesar Cipher is not secure for real-world cryptographic use
